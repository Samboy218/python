I'm tired of needing to merge pdf documents, and getting all of these annoying
    websites who think it's okay for me to upload my documents to their 
    processing system.


For this you need to have pypdf2
--> $ python3 -m pip install pypdf2

and you're good to go!

This program takes 3 command line arguments:
Input1 Input2 Output

Input2 will be concatenated onto Input1, 
    and this new file will be put into Output
