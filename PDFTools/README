I'm tired of needing to merge pdf documents, and getting all of these annoying
websites who think it's okay for me to upload my documents to their 
processing system.


For this you need to have pypdf2
--> $ python3 -m pip install pypdf2

and you're good to go!

This program takes in a list of files to be merged together
the -o flag can be used to specify the file to output to (default="out.pdf")

Example:

python3 merge.py file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf -o merged.pdf
